# cs231n_2020_version
This repository is to record the assignments that I've done for a junior course at Stanford University as cs231n by FeiFei Li.  
  
Due to the restriction of uploaded storage, I didn't upload the dataset, also because it's easy to download from the official website.  
Noted that files like checkpoint are not uploaded, since these files are hidden and we don't have access to it, also we don't have to change it at all.
